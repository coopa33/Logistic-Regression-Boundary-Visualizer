# Logistic-Regression-Boundary-Visualizer

I want to create an interactive app for visualizing Decision Boundaries in Logistic Regression using Shiny. 

This app should be able to visualize decision boundaries of two features at a time. With high dimensional data, the idea is to be able to visualize all possible permutations of feature pairs. The ideal parameters are calculated using gradient descent, but should also be adjustable by the user to see changes in the Decision Boundary. 

The preliminary version of the app can be tested at (here)[https://coopa33.github.io/Logistic-Regression-Boundary-Visualizer/]
