**Before visualization**
- Create Function to input data and output parameters based on linear term and logistic activation function
- Create Function to calculate linear decision boundary, with calculated parameters as input, and decision coordinate (x_1, x_2) as output.
- Create Function to select features from dataset to use

**Visualization**
- Create adjustable feature selector
- Create coefficient weight adjustor
- Plot labelled datapoints and decision boundary
